# Arcade Game

## Installation

Just view the index.html in the browser.

## How to Play

Move the player one tile at a time horizontally of vertically in order to get to the water. Each time you get to the water your score is incremented by 1. Try winning as many consecutive times as you can!

BEWARE the malicious speeding bugs! You must avoid getting hit by the bugs, otherwise you are sent back to the start and your score becomes 0! :(

You may choose a different character as your player from the drop down menu on the right.

Students should use this [rubric](https://review.udacity.com/#!/projects/2696458597/rubric) for self-checking their submission. Make sure the functions you write are **object-oriented** - either class functions (like Player and Enemy) or class prototype functions such as Enemy.prototype.checkCollisions, and that the keyword 'this' is used appropriately within your class and class prototype functions to refer to the object the function is called upon. Also be sure that the **readme.md** file is updated with your instructions on both how to 1. Run and 2. Play your arcade game.

For detailed instructions on how to get started, check out this [guide](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1v01aScPjSWCCWQLIpFqvg3-vXLH2e8_SZQKC8jNO0Dc/pub?embedded=true).
